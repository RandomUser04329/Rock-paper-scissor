This is a small Project for the odin project that is entirely based in Javascript. 
Its also my first small project entirely based in javascript and i think i did ok for my first attempt at coding something in JS. 
The game works well and i had did multiple tests to make sure that it isn't miscounting iterations or is checking for misspelled words etc.

To play it, the game is entirely based in the console although it will ask you for input when you first open the html file. 

I would like to add a little more to the code like a delay between input and a working ui in the html for the game, but for now i think this is far as ill go since i have a lot more to learn with the language.

Anyways, enjoy and put some feedback on what i could fix to make the code simpler or any suggestions!
